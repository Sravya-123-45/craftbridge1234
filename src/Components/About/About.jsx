                    Addressing the limitations faced by traditional Indian artisans in accessing global markets, 
                    our project 'Exploring Bharat's Culture and Heritage: Bharat's Traditional Artisans' establishes 
                    an online platform. This initiative aims to connect artisans with a wider audience, promoting and 
                    selling authentic, handmade crafts to preserve India's cultural heritage. The platform enables 
                    direct interaction between artisans and a global community, offering a curated marketplace with 
                    seamless e-commerce functionality utilizing a tech stack of React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and 
                    Node.js. The project aims to create a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem that empowers artisans and 
                    enhances cross-cultural appreciation for Bharat's diverse artistic traditions.
